# About

I'm Kris. I prototype and build machine learning models, particularly deep learning models. Right now, I'm participating in a a fellowship at [fellowship.ai](https://fellowship.ai/), contributing to a [computer vision product](https://platform.ai/).

My working style:
- I prototype fast, but go over details before presenting my work.
- I prefer to Pytorch over Tensorflow, Python over R (except for plotting).
- I use (maybe over-use) Jupyter notebooks - a great tool for prototyping.
- I like to understand models from the ground up. I almost never build anything from just basic matrix (tensor) operations, but I like to know that I could, if needed to.

Before doing machine learning, I worked in insurance as an actuary. Then, two years ago, I decided to take a sabbatical. I travelled to Asia, trained in a kung fu school, meditated in a Thai monastery, and fell in love. When I came back to London, I decided to transition into ML.

## Latest News
- I will finish my current fellowship at the end of April. If youâ€™re in London and are looking for a ML engineer, feel free to reach out (krisztiankovacs@fastmail.com).
