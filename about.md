I'm Krisztian Kovacs. I created this site to document the stuff I learn, the tools I use, and the ideas that inevitably pop into my head. Mostly about statistics and ML.

Last year I decided to take some time off work. I travelled to Asia, trained in a kung fu school, meditated in a Thai monastery, and fell in love.

Then I determined to expand my knowledge on machine learning - deep learning in particular. Hence this site - I will post on my progress and my notes.
