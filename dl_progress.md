At the beginning of September 2018, [I made a plan]({% post_url 2018-09-01-dl-journey-overview %}) to spend the next 25 weeks studying deep learning. This page gives updates on my progress.

#### Week 1
I spent this week reviewing prerequisites. To brush up on machine learning, I completed [Andrew Ng's course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) (I only had 4 weeks of material left). I skimmed part 1 of [Ian Goodfellows book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) for a more technical review. Up until this point I find his book too theoretical, parts like the "no free lunch theorem" could have easily been skipped. For python syntax, I watched some lectures on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/), and completed the associated exercises.

I finished with my plan ahead of schedule, watching the fast.ai videos on single label image classification. I coded up some of my own experiments, such as a [Jupyter notebook that downloads pictures of Obama and Trump and builds an image classifier based on them](https://github.com/kk1694/fastai_projects1/blob/master/Obama_Trump_Classification.ipynb).
