At the beginning of September 2018, [I made a plan]({% post_url 2018-09-01-dl-journey-overview %}) to spend the next 25 weeks studying deep learning. This page gives updates on my progress.

#### Week 1
I spent this week reviewing prerequisites. To brush up on machine learning, I completed [Andrew Ng's course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) (I only had 4 weeks of material left). I skimmed part 1 of [Ian Goodfellows book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) for a more technical review. Up until this point I find his book too theoretical, parts like the "no free lunch theorem" could have easily been skipped. For python syntax, I watched some lectures on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/), and completed the associated exercises.

I finished with my plan ahead of schedule, watching the fast.ai videos on single label image classification. I coded up some of my own experiments, such as a [Jupyter notebook that downloads pictures of Obama and Trump and builds an image classifier based on them](https://github.com/kk1694/fastai_projects1/blob/master/Obama_Trump_Classification.ipynb).

#### Week 2

Completed much of the fast.ai course. Created a [Harry Potter image classifier]({% post_url 2018-09-09-harry-potter-image-classification %}). Coded up toy drafts on [structured learning](https://github.com/kk1694/fastai_projects1/blob/master/predict_future_sales.ipynb), [recommender systems](https://github.com/kk1694/fastai_projects1/blob/master/joke_recommendations.ipynb), and [nlp](https://github.com/kk1694/fastai_projects1/blob/master/joke_prediction.ipynb) using different datasets than in the course (didn't optimize for good results though). Through them I familiarized myself with fast.ai and pytorch code.

#### Week 3

I watched the first two parts of the Coursera deep learning lecture by Andrew Ng. Completed the first two weeks of material for Siraj Raval's School of AI course. Slightly behind completing part 1 of fast.ai.

#### Week 4

I finished part 1 of the fast.ai course, and watched the Coursera DL lectures up to part 5. Completed week 3 of the Move37 RL course.

I also started working on the [Inclusive Images](https://www.kaggle.com/c/inclusive-images-challenge) competition on Kaggle. Thanks to google, all participants received $1000 worth of computing credits on google cloud. I set up my google cloud machine and downloaded the images (which, taking more than 500 GB, needed more than a day to download).

#### Week 5

This week I started blitzing through Coursera's deep learning specialization. I finished the first four out of five parts/modules. Each part is supposed to take a few weeks; however, I have already watched most of the lectures, and the programming assignments are extremely easy. I will finish early next week.
