description: Giving DL a shot
---
I've decided to give deep learning a shot.

There is definitely a lot of hype about the topic, and it sounds quite interesting. I'm not sure yet whether I want to treat it as a fun side-project or a potential career, but I do have a lot of free time nowadays, and learning DL seems like a good investment.

It shouldn't be too hard. I have experience with "traditional" machine learning, I'm comfortable with heavy math, and I'm familiar with simple feed-forward neural nets. 

I'll treat it as a "flexible" 6 month project, spending 20-40 hours a week on it. I'll post my tentative study plan in a few days.
